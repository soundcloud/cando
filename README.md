CanDo is a small gem to implement a simple user access system based on users, roles &
capabilites, where:

  - each user can have 0, 1 or many roles
  - each role can have 0, 1 or many capabilites

Users have capabilities by getting roles assigned (role == collection of
capabilities). Within the code, the `can` helper method can be used to test
whether a user has a certain capability or not (see below for a working code example).

## Dependencies

CanDo depends on the following software:

* [sequel](http://sequel.jeremyevans.net)
* [rake](https://github.com/jimweirich/rake)


## Installation and deployment

Download and install rake with the following.

        gem install cando

## Configuration and usage

### Database setup & configuration
If you want to use an individual database for cando, create the db + credentials (adjust values):

    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS cando  DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    GRANT ALL ON `cando`.* to 'cando_user'@'localhost' identified by 'cando_passwd';

Whenever you want to use a CanDo rake task, you need to set the database config via the env var `$CANDO_DB`:

     export CANDO_TEST_DB=mysql://cando_user:cando_passwd@localhost/cando

for other dbs, [see the sequel
documentation](http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/classes/Sequel.html#method-c-connect).
**Note that you will have to require the gem for your respective dbms, i.e. the
`mysql`-gem for mysql, the `sqlite3`-gem for sqlite, etc. **

### Init cando
Cando provides a rake task to get you started. This will setup the necessary
tables (they are all prefixed with `cando` and thus should not interfere with
your database.

    rake cando:init

### Using rake tasks
Cando provides several useful rake tasks for easy cli-based operations. In order
to use those edit (or create) the `Rakefile` and include

    require 'cando'

 To get an overview, execute:

     $ rake -T cando
     rake cando:init     # Initialize cando (creates schema and runs migration)

     rake cando:list     # List roles
     rake cando:add      # Add a new role (pass in role name and capabilities with role=<name> capabilities=<cap1>,<cap2>,...
     rake cando:update   # Update role (pass in role name and capabilities with role=<name> capabilities=<cap1>,<cap2>,...
     rake cando:remove   # Remove role (pass in role name with role=<name>)

     rake cando:assign   # Assign role to user (args: roles=<r1>,<r2>,<rn> user=<user_urn>)
     rake cando:users    # List users and their roles

### Using CanDo in your project's code

#### Api
Please see [the api documentation](http://rubydoc.info/gems/cando/CanDo) up to date documentation.

 connect to db (usually called within init block):

    CanDo.connect "mysql://user:passwd@host:port/database"

 create a role; capabilities will be created if they don't exist yet:

    define_role("role_name", ["capability1","capability2", "capability3", ...])

 assign role(s) to a user: if no user with that id exist, a new one will
 be created; if a role does not exist, an exception is raised. You can pass
 in a role object or just role names; pass in empty array to remove all roles:

    role3 = CanDo::Role.first
    assign_roles("user1", ["role1", "role2", role3])

 get user's capabilities; returns an array of strings:

    capabilities("user1")

 get user's roles; returns an array of strings:

    roles("user1")

 set default handler if `can("u","c"){ ... }` fails (usually called within init block):

    CanDo.cannot_block { |user_urn, capability| raise "#{user_urn} is missing #{capability}" }

 guard block by `can` function; will execute `cannot_block` if user is missing
 this capability (see example below):

    can("user1", :capability1) do
      puts "woohoo"
    end

 use `can` function as an expression -- `cannot_block` will not be executed if
 expressions resolves to `false`:

    if can("user1", :capability1)
       puts "woohoo"
    else
       puts ":("
    end

#### Usage example
Using the CanDo in your code (working code with an empty database):

    require 'cando'
    include CanDo

    CanDo.init do
      # if passed, this will be executed if the user does not have the
      # asked-for capability (only applies if 'can' is passed a block)
      cannot_block do |user_urn, capability|
        raise "#{user_urn} can not #{capability} .. user capabilities are: #{capabilities(user_urn)}"
      end

      connect "mysql://cando_user:cando_passwd@host:port/database"
    end

    # if the role or a capability does not exist, it'll be created
    define_role("r1", ["capability1", "capability3"])
    define_role("r2", ["capability2"])
    define_role("r3", ["capability3"])

    # if the user does not exist, he'll be created -- the roles must be available
    assign_roles("user1", ["r1"])
    # add other roles by unifying arrays with '|'
    assign_roles("user1", roles("user1") | ["r2","r3"])

    assign_roles("user2", ["r1"])

    # use 'can' block syntax
    can("user1", :capability1) do
      puts "user has capability1"
    end

    # this will raise an exception as declared in the init block
    can("user1", :super_admin) do
      puts "hey hoh" # this will not be printed
    end

    # when no block is given, 'can' returns true or false/nil
    unless can("user2", :capability2)
      puts "user does not have capability1"
    end

## Versioning
CanDo adheres to Semantic Versioning 2.0.0. If there is a violation of
this scheme, report it as a bug.Specifically, if a patch or minor version is
released and breaks backward compatibility, that version should be immediately
yanked and/or a new version should be immediately released that restores
compatibility. Any change that breaks the public API will only be introduced at
a major-version release. As a result of this policy, you can (and should)
specify any dependency on <project name> by using the Pessimistic Version
Constraint with two digits of precision.
